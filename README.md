# point_picker
This is simple proof of concept Python code that uses PyVista, VTK and Tkinter
to provide an primitive interface for annotating a printed circuit board.

The code may be started with:

python pick_points.py qspi_monitor.json

The "qspi_monitor.json" file includes information on the 3D object, the transform used to display it and any annotated points.
